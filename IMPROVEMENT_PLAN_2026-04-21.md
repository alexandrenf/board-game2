# Improvement Plan — 2026-04-21

**Based on:** AUDIT_REPORT_2026-04-21.md  
**Priority order:** Critical → Moderate → Minor → Enhancements  
**Target branch:** master

## FIX-01 — Persist `quizAnswer` in solo mode  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**References:** BUG-01  
**Files:** `src/game/state/gameState.ts`

### Problem
`saveProgress` does not persist `quizAnswer`. On app restart from a `'feedback'` quiz phase, the UI incorrectly shows "Incorreto" regardless of the player's actual answer.

### Fix

**Step 1 — Add `quizAnswer` to `saveProgress`:**

```ts
// src/game/state/gameState.ts — saveProgress()
const progress = {
  playerIndex: state.playerIndex,
  targetIndex: state.targetIndex,
  focusTileIndex: state.focusTileIndex,
  lastMessage: state.lastMessage,
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  pendingEffect: state.pendingEffect,
  quizPhase: state.quizPhase,
  usedQuestionIds: state.usedQuestionIds,
  quizPoints: state.quizPoints,
  currentQuiz: state.currentQuiz,
  quizAnswer: state.quizAnswer,   // ← ADD THIS
};
```

**Step 2 — Restore `quizAnswer` in `hydrateFromPersistence`:**

```ts
// In the savedProgress hydration block:
if (savedProgress.quizAnswer !== undefined) {
  nextState.quizAnswer = savedProgress.quizAnswer;
}
```

**Step 3 — Extend the cast type:**

```ts
const savedProgress = savedProgressRaw as (typeof savedProgressRaw & {
  pendingEffect?: TileEffect | null;
  quizPhase?: QuizPhase;
  usedQuestionIds?: string[];
  quizPoints?: number;
  currentQuiz?: { question: QuizQuestion; startedAt: number; tileColor: string } | null;
  quizAnswer?: { selectedOptionId: string | null; result: QuizResult } | null;  // ← ADD
});
```

**Step 4 — Handle edge case: `quizPhase === 'feedback'` without `quizAnswer`**

Add a guard in `hydrateFromPersistence`: if the restored phase is `'feedback'` but `quizAnswer` is null (data from before this fix), reset to `'idle'` to avoid a broken state:

```ts
if (nextState.quizPhase === 'feedback' && !nextState.quizAnswer) {
  nextState.quizPhase = 'idle';
  nextState.currentQuiz = null;
}
```

## FIX-02 — Emit `quiz_cancelled` event from `leaveRoom`  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**References:** BUG-02, BUG-10  
**Files:** `convex/rooms.ts`

### Problem
When a player leaves mid-quiz, the round is marked `cancelled` in the DB but no event is broadcast. The event processor handler for `quiz_cancelled` in the client is dead code. Other players' quiz UI clears only when the snapshot syncs.

### Fix

In `convex/rooms.ts`, inside the `leaveRoom` mutation, after cancelling the quiz round, add a `quiz_cancelled` event to the existing `insertRoomEvents` call:

```ts
// Find the block that patches activeQuizRound._id to 'cancelled'
if (activeQuizRound?.status === 'active') {
  await ctx.db.patch(activeQuizRound._id, {
    status: 'cancelled',
    resolvedAt: now,
  });

  // ADD: emit event so clients clear the modal immediately
  await insertRoomEvents(ctx, room._id, roomPatch.nextEventSequence ?? room.nextEventSequence, now, [
    {
      type: 'quiz_cancelled',
      actorPlayerId: player._id,
      turnId: room.currentTurnId ?? '',
      turnNumber: room.turnNumber,
      phase: 'awaiting_roll',
      payload: {
        roundId: activeQuizRound._id,
        reason: 'player_left',
      },
    },
  ]);
}
```

Ensure `roomPatch.nextEventSequence` is updated after this insertion (same pattern as other event insertions in `leaveRoom`).

## FIX-03 — Allow quiz feedback dismissal when `latestResolvedTurn` is absent  
**Priority:** MODERATE  
**References:** BUG-03  
**Files:** `src/components/game/MultiplayerOverlay.tsx`

### Problem
`handleDismissQuizFeedback` calls `handleDismissResolvedTurn()` which returns `false` if `latestResolvedTurn` is null, causing the player to be permanently stuck on the feedback screen.

### Fix

Separate quiz dismissal from turn acknowledgement. The turn ACK must happen, but the local quiz UI can be cleared optimistically:

```ts
const handleDismissQuizFeedback = useCallback(async () => {
  // Always clear quiz UI immediately — don't wait for ACK
  dismissQuizFeedback();

  // Then attempt turn acknowledgement
  await handleDismissResolvedTurn();
}, [handleDismissResolvedTurn, dismissQuizFeedback]);
```

**Why this is safe:** The quiz modal's visibility is driven by `currentQuizRound` and `quizResolvedData` (runtime store), not by `latestResolvedTurn`. Clearing the quiz state locally does not affect the ACK flow. If the ACK fails, the HUD will still show the turn pending state (via `latestResolvedTurn`) and the player can retry.

---

## FIX-04 — Remove `assets/questions.json` (stale file)  
**Priority:** MODERATE  
**References:** BUG-05  
**Files:** `assets/questions.json`

### Problem
This 24-question file is in a deprecated format (`themeId: 'tema-1'`) and is not imported anywhere. It was added in the initial commit and superseded by `src/content/quizQuestions.ts` in the refactor commit.

### Fix

Delete the file:
```
git rm assets/questions.json
```

If it is needed as a historical reference, move it to `textos/` (where other reference documents live) and add a comment at the top explaining it is unused.

## FIX-05 — Clarify yellow theme question status  
**Priority:** MODERATE  
**References:** BUG-04  
**Files:** `src/content/quizQuestions.ts`, `src/content/quizQuestionAdapter.ts`

### Problem
12 yellow-theme questions are fully written, cited, and tested, but `isQuizEligibleTile` excludes yellow tiles — making them permanently unreachable.

### Option A — Activate yellow tiles for quizzes (recommended if there is content)
Add `'yellow'` to `QUIZ_TILE_COLORS` in `gameState.ts` and to the `isQuizEligibleTile` color check in `convex/quiz.ts`. Add effect behavior for yellow tiles in `quizEffectResolver.ts` (e.g., `default` case currently returns `stay` — which is acceptable). Update `effectLabel` in `constants.ts` for yellow.

### Option B — Remove yellow questions until yellow tiles are planned
Remove `...QUIZ_QUESTION_BANK.yellow` from the `QUIZ_QUESTIONS` array and remove the yellow theme from the `it.each(themes)` test. Add a code comment in `quizQuestions.ts` marking yellow as "reserved for future use."

**Choose Option A** if yellow tiles are part of the current game design. Choose Option B to reduce dead code. Either way, the current state (questions written but unreachable) should not remain.

## FIX-06 — Fix `myAnswer.playerId` type inconsistency  
**Priority:** MINOR  
**References:** BUG-06  
**Files:** `src/services/multiplayer/runtimeStore.ts`

### Fix

Make `playerId` optional in `MultiplayerQuizAnswer`:

```ts
type MultiplayerQuizAnswer = {
  playerId?: string;   // optional — not present in server snapshot's myAnswer
  selectedOptionId: string | null;
  result: QuizResult;
  pointsAwarded: number;
  answeredAt?: number;
  timeElapsedMs?: number;
};
```

Alternatively, add `playerId` to the server's `myAnswer` response in `getRoomState`:

```ts
myAnswer: myQuizAnswer
  ? {
      playerId: myPlayer._id,   // ← ADD
      selectedOptionId: ...,
      ...
    }
  : null,
```

The second approach is preferred because it makes the snapshot fully self-describing.

---

## FIX-07 — Show quiz points in solo mode  
**Priority:** MINOR  
**References:** BUG-08  
**Files:** `src/components/game/GameOverlay.tsx`

### Problem
`quizPoints` is tracked in solo state but never displayed to the player.

### Fix

Pass a single-element `scoreboardPlayers` array to `GamePlayingHUD`:

```ts
// In GameOverlay.tsx
const scoreboardPlayers = useMemo(
  () => quizPoints > 0
    ? [{ id: 'solo', name: playerName || 'Você', points: quizPoints, isMe: true }]
    : [],
  [playerName, quizPoints]
);

// In the JSX:
<GamePlayingHUD
  ...
  scoreboardPlayers={scoreboardPlayers}
  ...
/>
```

This shows the score pill only after the first correct answer, avoiding clutter at game start.

---

## FIX-08 — Restore educational modal after solo quiz  
**Priority:** MINOR  
**References:** BUG-09  
**Files:** `src/game/state/gameState.ts`

### Problem
After dismissing quiz feedback in solo mode, the standalone educational modal is never shown. The quiz modal's feedback panel already displays tile content, so this is partially mitigated — but the dedicated educational modal provides a larger, more focused reading experience.

### Decision Required
Two valid approaches:

**Option A — Always show educational modal after quiz (recommended)**  
In `dismissQuizFeedback`, after setting `quizPhase: 'idle'`, trigger the educational modal:
```ts
set({
  quizPhase: 'idle',
  currentQuiz: null,
  quizAnswer: null,
  // DON'T clear currentTileContent and showEducationalModal here
  showEducationalModal: true,            // ← re-enable after quiz
  educationalModalDelayMs: 200,          // short delay for animation
});
```

**Option B — Keep current behavior, enrich quiz feedback panel**  
Accept that the quiz modal is the educational experience and ensure the educational text in the feedback panel is large and readable. No code change needed.

---

## FIX-09 — Add `quizSelector` unit tests  
**Priority:** MINOR  
**Files:** `src/domain/game/__tests__/quizSelector.test.ts` (new file)

### Why
`quizSelector.ts` has no tests. It is used in both solo and multiplayer modes to pick questions. Edge cases (empty bank, all questions used, themeId not found) should be tested.

### Tests to add

```ts
describe('quizSelector', () => {
  const bank: QuizQuestion[] = [
    { id: 'q1', themeId: 'green', ... },
    { id: 'q2', themeId: 'green', ... },
    { id: 'q3', themeId: 'red', ...   },
  ];

  it('returns a question matching the themeId', () => {
    const q = selectQuestion('green', [], bank);
    expect(q?.themeId).toBe('green');
  });

  it('avoids already-used question IDs', () => {
    const q = selectQuestion('green', ['q1'], bank);
    expect(q?.id).toBe('q2');
  });

  it('falls back to any theme question when all are used', () => {
    const q = selectQuestion('green', ['q1', 'q2'], bank);
    expect(q?.themeId).toBe('green'); // fallback still respects theme
  });

  it('returns null when no questions exist for the theme', () => {
    expect(selectQuestion('blue', [], bank)).toBeNull();
  });

  it('returns null on empty bank', () => {
    expect(selectQuestion('green', [], [])).toBeNull();
  });
});
```

---

## FIX-10 — Convert `usedQuestionIds` to a `Set` in `quizSelector`  
**Priority:** MINOR (Performance)  
**Files:** `src/domain/game/quizSelector.ts`

### Fix

```ts
export function selectQuestion(
  themeId: string,
  usedQuestionIds: string[],
  questionBank: QuizQuestion[]
): QuizQuestion | null {
  const usedSet = new Set(usedQuestionIds);   // ← convert once, O(n)
  const candidates = questionBank.filter(
    (q) => q.themeId === themeId && !usedSet.has(q.id)   // ← O(1) per check
  );
  ...
}
```

This changes the overall filter from O(n×m) to O(n+m).

---

## FIX-11 — Remove duplicate `RoomQuizAnswer`/`RoomQuizRound` types  
**Priority:** MINOR (Maintainability)  
**Files:** `src/components/game/MultiplayerOverlay.tsx`, `src/services/multiplayer/runtimeStore.ts`

### Problem
`MultiplayerOverlay.tsx` defines `RoomQuizAnswer` and `RoomQuizRound` locally. `runtimeStore.ts` defines `MultiplayerQuizAnswer` and `MultiplayerQuizRound` for the same data. Two separate type definitions for the same shape create divergence risk.

### Fix
Export the types from `runtimeStore.ts` and import them in `MultiplayerOverlay.tsx`:

```ts
// runtimeStore.ts — add exports
export type { MultiplayerQuizAnswer, MultiplayerQuizRound };

// MultiplayerOverlay.tsx — remove local types, import shared ones
import type { MultiplayerQuizAnswer as RoomQuizAnswer } from '@/src/services/multiplayer/runtimeStore';
```

---

## FIX-12 — Harden multiplayer quiz feedback for missing `script` in `quiz_resolved`  
**Priority:** MODERATE  
**Files:** `src/services/multiplayer/runtimeStore.ts`, `src/components/game/MultiplayerOverlay.tsx`

### Problem
If the `quiz_resolved` event payload contains a malformed `script`, `parseTurnScript` returns `null`. `applyQuizResolved` sets `latestResolvedTurn: null ?? state.latestResolvedTurn`. In a fresh session this is `undefined`, causing `handleDismissQuizFeedback` to stall (see FIX-03). This is a separate hardening beyond FIX-03.

### Fix in `applyQuizResolved`
When `script` is null (event did not include it or it is malformed), synthesize a minimal turn script from the current state to allow the dismiss flow to proceed:

```ts
// After parsing script from payload:
const effectiveScript = script ?? (get().latestResolvedTurn) ?? null;
// Use effectiveScript for latestResolvedTurn assignment
```

This avoids regressing to `undefined` even when the event payload is incomplete.

---

## FIX-13 — Show quiz modal only after movement animation completes (multiplayer)
**Priority:** MODERATE (UX correctness)  
**Files:** `src/services/multiplayer/runtimeStore.ts`, `src/components/game/MultiplayerOverlay.tsx`

### Problem
In multiplayer mode, the server emits `turn_resolved` (with `awaitingQuiz: true`) and `quiz_started` in the same batch as the dice roll. The client processes both events immediately, setting `currentQuizRound` before the 3D token has finished animating to the landing tile. The quiz modal therefore appears while the player's token is still visually in motion, overlapping the movement and breaking the cause-and-effect narrative of the game.

The expected experience is: token moves → token arrives on tile → quiz modal slides up.

### Root cause
`applyQuizStarted` in `runtimeStore.ts` sets `currentQuizRound` synchronously when the event is processed. `quizModalVisible` in `MultiplayerOverlay.tsx` becomes `true` as soon as `currentQuizRound` is non-null, with no gate on movement completion.

Movement completion is signalled by `markActorArrived(actorId)` — called by the 3D scene component when the token finishes its path. However, in the quiz flow `pendingEffectQueue` is empty (effect was stripped), so `markActorArrived` does nothing meaningful today.

### Fix

**Step 1 — Add `quizActorArrived` flag to the runtime store:**

```ts
// runtimeStore.ts — add to RuntimeStore type
quizActorArrived: boolean;

// add to emptyState
quizActorArrived: false,
```

**Step 2 — Reset the flag when a quiz round starts:**

```ts
// In applyQuizStarted, add to the set() call:
quizActorArrived: false,
```

Also reset in `dismissQuizFeedback` and `applyTurnStarted` to clean up between turns:

```ts
// dismissQuizFeedback — add:
quizActorArrived: false,

// applyTurnStarted — add:
quizActorArrived: false,
```

**Step 3 — Set the flag when the acting player's token arrives:**

`markActorArrived` is called by the 3D scene for every actor that finishes moving. Add a check: if there is a `currentQuizRound` pending arrival and the arriving actor is the current turn's actor, mark arrival:

```ts
markActorArrived: (actorId) => {
  set((state) => {
    // --- NEW: resolve quiz actor arrival ---
    const quizArrivedPatch =
      state.currentQuizRound &&
      !state.quizActorArrived &&
      actorId === state.currentTurnPlayerId
        ? { quizActorArrived: true }
        : {};

    // existing effect-queue logic (unchanged) ...
    const hasEffectQueueItems = ...;
    ...

    return {
      ...quizArrivedPatch,
      // ... existing return fields
    };
  });
},
```

**Step 4 — Gate `quizModalVisible` on arrival in `MultiplayerOverlay.tsx`:**

```ts
// Add selector
const quizActorArrived = useMultiplayerRuntimeStore((state) => state.quizActorArrived);

// Update quizModalVisible
const quizModalVisible = Boolean(
  currentQuizRound &&
    quizActorArrived &&                          // ← new: wait for movement to finish
    roomState?.room.status === 'playing' &&
    (roomState.room.turnPhase === 'awaiting_quiz' || quizResolvedData)
);
```

### Edge case: late-joining clients and snapshot sync

A client that joins (or reconnects) mid-quiz will receive the room snapshot with `turnPhase: 'awaiting_quiz'` and `quizRound.status: 'active'`. In this case there is no movement animation to wait for — the token is already at the landing tile. `quizActorArrived` would be `false` and the modal would never open.

Fix: in `syncFromSnapshot`, when the snapshot has an active quiz round AND `turnPhase === 'awaiting_quiz'`, set `quizActorArrived: true` immediately (movement already done on the server before the snapshot arrived):

```ts
// In syncFromSnapshot, add to the set() patch:
quizActorArrived:
  snapshotQuizRound && snapshot.room.turnPhase === 'awaiting_quiz'
    ? true                           // late-join: no animation to wait for
    : state.quizActorArrived,        // preserve existing flag
```

### Testing
Verify that:
1. Rolling onto a quiz tile plays the full movement animation before the modal appears.
2. A player who joins mid-quiz sees the modal immediately without waiting for an animation.
3. After the quiz feedback is dismissed and a new turn starts, `quizActorArrived` resets properly.

## Content Recommendations (Non-code)

### CR-01 — Medical / Public Health Review  
**Priority:** HIGH before production

All 48 questions should be reviewed by a qualified HIV/AIDS public health specialist or infectious disease clinician before the game is used by real students. Specific areas to validate:
- Transmission risk quantification in red tile questions
- PrEP / PEP efficacy claims
- Statements about undetectable = untransmittable (U=U)
- Condom effectiveness percentages
- Vertical transmission prevention claims

### CR-02 — Add source links to UI  
**Priority:** LOW

`QUIZ_SOURCES` in `quizQuestions.ts` includes full URLs to Ministério da Saúde, CDC, WHO, and PAHO. These are not surfaced to the player anywhere. Consider showing a "Saiba mais" (Learn more) link in the quiz feedback panel pointing to the relevant source for each question. This deepens learning and cites credible authorities.

### CR-03 — Accessibility of accented characters  
**Priority:** LOW

Several UI strings use Portuguese with accented characters but display with a font that may not support them consistently on all Android devices. Audit `QuizModal.tsx` strings (e.g., "Explicacao", "Conteudo educativo") and restore proper accents where stripped.

### CR-04 — Review `textos/` content alignment with question bank  
The `textos/TEXTOS PARA O JOGO.txt` and `textos/textos-jogo-temas.json` files contain educational content. Verify that the educational text on each tile (`board.json` → `tile.text`) is consistent with the quiz questions assigned to that tile's theme. A red tile whose text discusses one topic should not have a quiz question about a different topic.
